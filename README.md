# MMv3

MMv3 is the 3rd generation robot platform used to teach the IEEE Micromouse DeCal at UC Berkeley. It was designed with usability, manufacturability, size, and cost in mind.

## Schedule

Skeleton lab code, lab documents, and solutions are stored in [labs/](labs/), [docs/](docs/), and [solutions/](solutions/), respectively. To get started with a lab, simply copy the contents of the folder over to the CircuitPython drive and edit files from there.

* [lab1](docs/lab1.md) - CircuitPython Basics
* [lab2](docs/lab2.md) - Assembly
* [sanity](docs/sanity.md) - Hardware Check
* [lab3](docs/lab3.md) - Encoders
* [lab4](docs/lab4.md) - IR Sensors
* [lab5](docs/lab5.md) - Odometry and Motor Control
* **Checkpoint 1**: Does your mouse drive?
* [lab6](docs/lab6.md) - Intro to PID
* [lab7](docs/lab7.md) - More PID
* **Checkpoint 2**: Does your mouse straight under PID control?
* [lab8](docs/lab8.md) - Maze Solving Primitives **(WIP)**
